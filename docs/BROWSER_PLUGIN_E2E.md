# Real-browser plugin object integration test (2026-10-13)

This test is **not** the C++ fake-backend regression `plugin.async_lifetime`.
The browser creates an actual JavaScript native-object proxy and calls a
**separately built** shared-library plugin (`tests/plugin/object_factory_plugin.cpp`).

## What it verifies

- `xytron.plugin.open(77)` forwards a JavaScript argument through the CEF or
  WebView2 bridge and the size-gated C ABI object-factory callback.
- The proxy method calls `value()` and `add(5)` return `77` and `82`.
- C ABI `counter_failure` and invalid factory arguments reach rejected promises.
- A live object makes explicit unload return `plugin_busy`; the existing
  object still works during quiesce.
- `dispose()` revokes the handle; a later method call rejects.
- Unload succeeds once the object has been released.
- The browser process exits with status zero and prints all four checkpoints.

## Linux CEF

CEF must first be downloaded with the pinned `tools/bootstrap_linux.sh`
command and `CEF_ROOT` must point to its extracted directory. Configure the
CEF integration *as its own standalone CMake project*:

```bash
cmake -S tests/integration/cef -B build/cef -DCEF_ROOT=/path/to/cef
cmake --build build/cef --config Release -j 4
python3 tools/run_browser_plugin_e2e.py --engine cef --build-dir build/cef
# or: ctest --test-dir build/cef -R browser.plugin_object_lifecycle --output-on-failure
```

The runner uses `xvfb-run -a` if DISPLAY is unset; it checks for all required
artifacts before launch and fails on browser timeouts or missing checkpoints.
It does not silently skip when CEF or the fixture library is missing.

## Windows CEF

```powershell
cmake -S tests/integration/cef -B build/cef -DCEF_ROOT=C:/path/to/cef
cmake --build build/cef --config Release
py -3 tools/run_browser_plugin_e2e.py --engine cef --build-dir build/cef
```

## Windows WebView2

Use the pinned WebView2 SDK NuGet extraction and a machine with Evergreen
Runtime installed.

```powershell
cmake -S tests/integration/webview2 -B build/webview2 -DWEBVIEW2_ROOT=C:/path/to/sdk
cmake --build build/webview2 --config Release
py -3 tools/run_browser_plugin_e2e.py --engine webview2 --build-dir build/webview2
```

Both integration builds additionally expose
`ctest -R browser.plugin_object_lifecycle --output-on-failure`.  The test
page is shared at `tests/integration/cef/plugin_bridge_test.html`.

**Local verification scope:** Linux core regression tests and test-page syntax
validation can run without CEF. A successful CEF/WebView2 browser E2E result
must only be recorded after a real SDK-backed engine run.

## CI

`.github/workflows/browser-plugin-e2e.yml` builds and runs the browser plugin
E2E in Linux CEF, Windows CEF, and Windows WebView2 environments. This is a
new, **unexecuted** workflow; it will run on a matching PR or by manual
workflow dispatch after the source is committed to a GitHub repository.

## Windows CEF archive extraction troubleshooting
Windows CEF CI previously downloaded and SHA1-verified the pinned 144 MB
minimal archive but stalled for 45 minutes during tar.exe -xjf extraction.
The Windows bootstrap now invokes tools/expand_cef_archive_windows.ps1,
which uses 7-Zip for the bzip2 and tar layers and deletes the intermediate tar.
A separate offline Windows fixture tests the extractor first and the workflow
caps real extraction at 20 minutes. The expected checksum and runtime layout
checks remain mandatory. This is a proposed fix until real Windows CEF E2E passes.
