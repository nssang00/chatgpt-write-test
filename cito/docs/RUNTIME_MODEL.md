# Cito Runtime Model v1 — Single Loop + Bounded Workers

## Goal

Keep the common path fast and predictable without exposing threading concepts in the normal Cito API.

Applications continue to use:

```cpp
cito::Context ctx;
ctx.on<Position>(handler);
ctx.publish(position);
ctx.run();
```

They do not create event loops, worker pools, network threads, or discovery threads.

## Ownership model

One event-loop thread owns mutable runtime state such as:

- discovery state
- interest index updates
- destination/route state
- transport I/O state
- timers and lease state
- callback/completion sequencing

This minimizes locks on the main runtime path and makes ordering easier to reason about.

## Worker pool

The worker pool is:

- bounded
- lazily started on first submitted work
- not an owner of discovery/transport state
- used only for isolated CPU-heavy or blocking operations
- followed by completion posting back to the event loop

Candidate work includes sufficiently heavy serialization/compression, certificate/crypto operations, file-backed tooling, and adapters that would otherwise block the loop. Small messages should stay on the fast path when offload overhead would cost more than the work itself.

## Backpressure

Both event and worker queues are bounded. A full queue is an explicit condition, not a reason to grow memory without limit or spawn more threads.

The exact public backpressure/error policy is not frozen yet.

## Current prototype validation

Unit tests verify:

- event queue capacity is bounded
- event-loop callbacks execute on one loop thread
- worker threads start lazily
- worker queue capacity is bounded
- offloaded work runs off the event-loop thread
- completion returns to the event-loop thread

Smoke tests verify the complete loop -> worker -> loop completion path.

The runtime prototype is still internal under `cito/detail`. It is intentionally not yet exposed through the public API while `Context::run()` semantics are being stabilized.
